Okay here is the idea:

We remove the mouse. 
We remove the colors and rounded edges.
The installation has a big old clicky keyboard. 
The installation is like a big black box. Inside the workings are mysterious. 

(or can you get inside).

Anyway, we have these screens (scan line I can do with overlay excellent)

Four or five or six or eights screens. ANd this giant black circle. 

And all the keyboards are black and clicky. 

And it lets you browse the internet, but there's no mouse, only keys. It's meant to kind of allow you to look with fresh eyes and reappreciate the amazing technology we have today as well as playfully say something about the past. ANd indulge in a bit of shameless fetishism for retro tech.
